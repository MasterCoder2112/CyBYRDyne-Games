Version Alpha 1.6 Dev 3(Optimization Dev):
Will optimize many components of gameplay making the game faster (using multi-threading) and having more optimized code. Also with this update is the update of collision detection to deal with the fact that walls can now be placed in the air. Lots of bug fixes, and changes to the maps to make them tell more of a story now instead of just being kind of there like they were. Also there are now resource packs that the game loads in instead of having various themes. Resource packs allow the user to customize the game to their liking by changing game mechanics, audio, textures, and the maps that the player can play, but does not change the default mechanics of the game or engine. Also items and entities are given more attributes so that doors can raise to different heights, doors and elevators can continue to keep moving, custom audio queues can be played upon activation of certain items, etc... Also you can now crouch under blocks.|
